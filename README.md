App name: My recipes
Live site: joyfulben.github.io

With this recipe app I hoped to have the user access a food API that provides and recipe title and directions summary.

The way I went about making this app is by accessing the API and finding out what data I could use to populate the app. I couldn't access all the data I needed from a simple query and so I nested an AJAX request inside of another AJAX request. I made every input of the general query a variable that takes input from the user with an input form.

My first priority was just to get everything to 90% functional before doing any styling. I worked a lot on the filter buttons that get added on dynamically through jquery. Then I made sure the recipe directions would be hidden until the user clicked on the recipe title. I researched making tooltips and only found plugins or libraries to download, so I decided to make one from scratch.
